# Tailwind Error Message Component

This is a simple error message component built while learning the basics of Tailwind CSS.

### Live Demo

### What I learned
- Using Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Applying colors, borders, spacing, and typography
- Using flexbox for layout and alignment
- Creating a responsive container
- Adding basic accessibility attributes

This project is part of my initial practice with Tailwind CSS.
